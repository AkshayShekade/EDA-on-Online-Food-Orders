# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to gain insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data.

## Objectives
- Explore the dataset to understand its characteristics and distributions.
- Identify relationships and correlations between variables.
- Detect outliers and anomalies.
- Visualize key features and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is [onlinefoods.csv].

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Taken
1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform data type conversions if necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Explore individual variables using summary statistics, histograms, and distribution plots.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices.
   - **Multivariate Analysis**: Investigate interactions between multiple variables using advanced visualization techniques.
4. **Insights and Findings**: Summarize key insights and findings obtained during the analysis.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to illustrate important trends and patterns discovered in the data.
6. **Conclusion**: Conclude the analysis by highlighting the main takeaways and potential next steps.

## Conclusion
Through this exploratory analysis, we gained valuable insights into the dataset, identified interesting patterns, and laid the foundation for further analysis or modeling tasks.
